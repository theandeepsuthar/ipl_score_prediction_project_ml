# ipl_score_prediction_project_ml

The IPL Score Prediction project is a machine learning-based project that aims to predict the scores of IPL (Indian Premier League) matches. 
By leveraging historical match data, the system utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide accurate score predictions for upcoming matches.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The system preprocesses the historical match data, cleaning and transforming it into a suitable format for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: The project incorporates relevant features such as team performance, player statistics, pitch conditions, and match location to enhance the prediction model.
- **Machine Learning Models**: The system employs various machine learning algorithms, such as regression models or ensemble methods, to predict the scores of IPL matches.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The project utilizes appropriate evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to assess the accuracy of the prediction models.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface allows users to interact with the system, input match details, and obtain score predictions for upcoming IPL matches.
